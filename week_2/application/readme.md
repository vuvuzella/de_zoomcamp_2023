Todo:

1. ~~Create Dockerfile for pipeline~~
2. ~~Create Docker-Compose file for week_2~~
3. ~~Create and run a simple prefect flow and task~~
4. Create terraform for any infrastructure needed to deploy prefect to the cloud
5. Do Assignment and update readme
6. Running from cli and running from vscode does not match. vscode does not see the etl_project as a module. Poetry refuses to run without without absolute path resolution to the modules
